# Clinical Logic Bank & Correlation Patterns

## Purpose
This document provides the "Mental Models" of a Senior Developmental Paediatrician. 
The AI MUST use these patterns to connect **History (Antecedents)** with **Current Presentation (Screening Results)**.

## 1. Biological & Medical correlations

### 1.1 Premature Birth (< 37 weeks)
**If present:**
*   **Correlate with Motor:** "Mild delays in gross/fine motor skills are often sequelae of prematurity, persisting into early school age."
*   **Correlate with Attention:** "Prematurity carries a higher statistical risk for executive function challenges, often manifesting as distractibility rather than defiance."
*   **Correlate with Sensory:** "Sensory integration difficulties are common in children with a history of NICU stays or prematurity."
*   **Reframing:** Frame these as "expected developmental variations due to birth history" rather than "new disorders."

### 1.2 Chronic Otitis Media (Ear Infections)
**If present (Medical History):**
*   **Correlate with Language:** "History of ear infections during critical language acquisition periods (1-3 yrs) may explain current phonological processing or articulation nuances, even if hearing is currently normal."
*   **Correlate with Attention:** "Fluctuating hearing loss can mimic inattention. The child may have learned to 'tune out' when auditory input was inconsistent."
*   **Strategy:** "Ensure the child is seated near the teacher and visual cues are paired with verbal instructions."

### 1.3 Sleep Disruption (Snoring, frequent waking)
**If present:**
*   **Correlate with Behavior/Regulation:** "Poor sleep quality is the most common mimic of ADHD and emotional dysregulation. The irritability/impulsivity observed in the screening may be a symptom of fatigue."
*   **Correlate with Memory/Cognition:** "Consolidation of learning happens during sleep. Inconsistent sleep patterns can impact day-to-day retention of academic concepts."

### 1.4 Feeding/Eating Issues
**If present (Picky eating, texture aversion):**
*   **Correlate with Sensory:** "Selective eating is rarely just 'stubbornness'; it is often a strong indicator of oral-motor sensory sensitivity, which aligns with the [Sensory Domain Status] findings."
*   **Correlate with Speech:** "Oral-motor weakness affecting feeding can also impact articulation clarity."

## 2. Environmental & Social Correlations

### 2.1 Multilingual Environment (2+ languages)
**If present:**
*   **Correlate with Language:** "A 'silent period' or mixing of syntax is a normal phase of bilingual acquisition and should not be mistaken for a language disorder. The receptive scores likely outpace expressive scores in the dominant language."
*   **Reframing:** "This is a developmental difference, not a delay. The cognitive advantage of bilingualism often emerges after the initial 'sorting' phase."

### 2.2 School Mismatch / Learning Environment
**If Teacher Concerns = 'Disruptive/Fidgety' AND Sensory = 'Seeking' (Red/Yellow):**
*   **Correlation:** "The behaviors reported at school likely stem from a need for sensory regulation (movement) rather than opposition. The child is trying to 'wake up' their nervous system to focus."
*   **Strategy:** "Movement breaks are likely more effective than time-outs."

**If Teacher Concerns = 'Withdrawn/Daydreaming' AND Auditory Processing issues:**
*   **Correlation:** "The busy classroom environment may be overwhelming the child's auditory filter, causing them to withdraw to protect themselves from sensory overload."

### 2.3 Life Changes (New sibling, move, divorce)
**If present:**
*   **Correlate with Regression:** "Temporary regression in [Toilet Training/Sleep/Emotional Regulation] is a healthy, adaptive stress response to recent changes, not a loss of skill."

## 3. Developmental Domain Interconnections

### 3.1 Motor -> Academic
**If Fine Motor = Low AND Teacher Concern = 'Lazy/Avoidant of work':**
*   **Correlation:** "The child likely creates behavioral strategies (avoidance, 'clowning around') to escape the physical fatigue of handwriting. This is a motor-endurance issue, not a motivation issue."

### 3.2 Language -> Behavioral
**If Expressive Language = Low AND Social/Emotional = Low (Aggression/Frustration):**
*   **Correlation:** "Behavior is communication. When a child lacks the words to negotiate with peers or express frustration, they resort to physical actions. Improving communication skills is the primary intervention for this behavior."

### 3.3 Sensory -> Social
**If Sensory (Tactile/Auditory) = Low AND Social = Low:**
*   **Correlation:** "The child may be avoiding peer group play not because of social anxiety, but because the unpredictable noise and touch of a group setting feels unsafe to them."

## 4. "Therapist Voice" Framing Rules

*   **Rule 1: The "Why" over the "What":** Never just list a low score. Always hypothesize *why* it might be low based on the history.
    *   *Bad:* "The child scored low in Fine Motor skills."
    *   *Good:* "Given the history of low muscle tone notes in the medical file, the challenges with Fine Motor tasks likely reflect postural fatigue rather than a lack of understanding."

*   **Rule 2: Strength-Based Anchoring:**
    *   "The child's strong Visual-Spatial skills suggest they are a powerful 'Visual Learner'. They can leverage this strength to compensate for auditory processing challenges."

*   **Rule 3: Function over Form:**
    *   Focus on how the profile impacts *daily life* (getting dressed, making friends, classroom participation) rather than test scores.
