# Domain Playbook — V2 Screening Report

## Purpose
This playbook provides **domain-specific clinical guidance** for generating the `domainDeepDives` section of the V2 Milestone Map Report. For each of the 8 developmental domains, it defines:
- What the domain measures
- Zone-specific clinical interpretation guidance
- How to frame **Impact on Daily Life**
- How to frame **Trajectory** (supported vs. unsupported)
- Key cross-domain connections to look for
- Recommended professional referrals by zone

The AI MUST generate a `domainDeepDives` entry for **ALL 8 domains** present in the screening results, using this playbook to shape the clinical analysis.

## Domain 1: Gross Motor (`grossMotor`)

### What It Measures
Large body movements: balance, coordination, stamina, motor planning, postural control, locomotion (walking, running, jumping, climbing).

### Zone Interpretation
- **Green:** Age-appropriate coordination and physical confidence. Protective factor for social participation in active play.
- **Yellow:** Emerging skills with mild gaps in coordination, endurance, or balance. The child may tire during physical activities or avoid playground equipment requiring complex motor planning.
- **Red:** Significant challenges in coordination, stamina, or motor planning. May avoid physical play or appear clumsy. Warrants professional evaluation.

### Impact on Daily Life — Framing Guide
- Playground participation (climbing, running games with peers)
- Classroom posture and physical endurance (sitting upright, transitioning between activities)
- Sports and group physical activities
- Safety during movement (falling, tripping frequency)
- Social inclusion in active peer play

### Trajectory Framing
- **Supported:** "With targeted physical therapy or structured gross motor activities, children in this range typically show measurable improvement in coordination and stamina within 3–6 months, enabling greater participation in physical play and peer activities."
- **Unsupported:** "Without intervention, gross motor challenges may lead to reduced physical activity, peer exclusion from active play, and secondary impacts on confidence and social participation."

### Cross-Domain Connections
- **Gross Motor → Social-Emotional:** Difficulty keeping up in physical play can lead to peer exclusion and reduced self-confidence.
- **Gross Motor → Sensory Processing:** Sensory-seeking children may appear hyperactive; sensory-avoidant children may resist movement activities. Check sensory domain for underlying cause.
- **Gross Motor → Adaptive Self-Care:** Core strength and coordination underpin dressing skills (buttons, zippers, shoes).

### Referral Guidance
- **Yellow:** Encourage structured outdoor play and active games. Monitor progress over 3 months.
- **Red:** Pediatric physical therapy evaluation. Rule out hypotonia, developmental coordination disorder (DCD), or neurological factors.

## Domain 2: Fine Motor (`fineMotor`)

### What It Measures
Small muscle control and hand-eye coordination: grasping, drawing, cutting, writing readiness, bead threading, block stacking, manipulating small objects.

### Zone Interpretation
- **Green:** Age-appropriate hand-eye coordination and dexterity. Strength that can be leveraged across academic and self-care tasks.
- **Yellow:** Emerging control with mild difficulties in precision tasks. May grip tools with excess force, produce immature letter forms, or fatigue during writing tasks.
- **Red:** Significant challenges with tool use, drawing, or manipulating small objects. Handwriting avoidance is common. Warrants occupational therapy evaluation.

### Impact on Daily Life — Framing Guide
- Classroom tasks: writing, drawing, cutting, coloring within lines
- Self-care: buttons, zippers, utensil use, teeth brushing
- Play: puzzles, building blocks, threading, craft activities
- Academic readiness and homework completion

### Trajectory Framing
- **Supported:** "With occupational therapy support and daily fine motor practice, children typically develop improved tool use and writing endurance, reducing classroom frustration."
- **Unsupported:** "Without support, fine motor challenges can be misinterpreted as laziness or non-compliance, as the child avoids physically effortful tasks like writing. This can cascade into academic disengagement."

### Cross-Domain Connections
- **Fine Motor → Cognitive Learning:** Fine motor is the vehicle for demonstrating cognitive ability. A child may understand a concept but cannot express it through writing. Do not conflate motor difficulty with cognitive delay.
- **Fine Motor → Adaptive Self-Care:** Dressing, feeding, and hygiene all depend on fine motor control.
- **Fine Motor → Social-Emotional:** Repeated failure at classroom tasks can erode self-esteem. If social-emotional is also flagged, consider fine motor frustration as a contributing factor.

### Referral Guidance
- **Yellow:** Daily fine motor activities (playdough, scissors practice, bead threading). Monitor over 3 months.
- **Red:** Occupational therapy evaluation. Assess for motor planning difficulties or underlying hypotonia.

## Domain 3: Speech & Language (`speechLanguage`)

### What It Measures
Receptive language (understanding), expressive language (speaking), articulation clarity, vocabulary breadth, sentence complexity, pragmatic language (social use of language).

### Zone Interpretation
- **Green:** Age-appropriate comprehension and expression. Vocabulary and sentence structure consistent with developmental expectations.
- **Yellow:** Emerging skills with mild gaps. May use shorter sentences, have limited vocabulary relative to peers, or show inconsistent articulation. Receptive language often outpaces expressive.
- **Red:** Significant delays in expression, comprehension, or both. May rely on gestures, have very limited vocabulary, or be difficult to understand by unfamiliar listeners. Warrants speech-language pathology evaluation.

### Impact on Daily Life — Framing Guide
- Following multi-step instructions at home and school
- Communicating needs, wants, and feelings to adults and peers
- Participating in classroom discussions and group activities
- Forming and maintaining friendships through verbal interaction
- Academic readiness (literacy, phonological awareness)

### Trajectory Framing
- **Supported:** "With speech-language therapy and a language-rich home environment, children with language delays can make significant gains, particularly when intervention begins early."
- **Unsupported:** "Without support, language delays may widen over time, impacting literacy development, social relationships, and emotional regulation (when a child cannot verbalize frustration)."

### Cross-Domain Connections
- **Speech & Language → Social-Emotional:** Language is the primary tool for social negotiation. Low language + low social-emotional often indicates frustration-driven behavior ("behavior is communication").
- **Speech & Language → Cognitive Learning:** Language delays can mask underlying cognitive strengths. A child who cannot express what they know may appear less capable than they are.
- **Speech & Language → Sensory Processing (Auditory):** If sensory processing is also flagged, auditory processing challenges may be contributing to receptive language difficulties.

### Bilingual Considerations (CRITICAL)
- **If the child is in a bilingual or multilingual environment:** A 'silent period' or mixing of syntax across languages is a NORMAL phase of bilingual acquisition and must NOT be interpreted as a language disorder.
- Receptive skills in the dominant home language often outpace expressive skills in the school language.
- Frame as "developmental difference, not delay" when bilingualism is present and receptive language is relatively intact.
- Recommend assessment in BOTH languages before concluding a true language disorder.

### Referral Guidance
- **Yellow:** Language-rich home strategies (daily reading, expanding utterances, narrating daily activities). Monitor over 3 months.
- **Red:** Speech-language pathology evaluation. If bilingual, request assessment in both languages.

## Domain 4: Social-Emotional (`socialEmotional`)

### What It Measures
Peer interaction quality, emotional regulation, empathy, social reciprocity, self-awareness, ability to manage frustration, turn-taking, cooperative play, attachment security.

### Zone Interpretation
- **Green:** Age-appropriate social skills and emotional regulation. Can navigate peer interactions, manage frustration with some support, and demonstrate empathy.
- **Yellow:** Emerging social skills with mild difficulties. May struggle with sharing, turn-taking, or managing big emotions. May need adult mediation in peer conflicts.
- **Red:** Significant challenges in peer interaction, emotional regulation, or both. May be aggressive, withdrawn, or have intense emotional outbursts. Warrants developmental or psychological evaluation.

### Impact on Daily Life — Framing Guide
- Forming and maintaining friendships
- Managing transitions and changes in routine
- Classroom behavior and group participation
- Emotional outbursts and recovery time
- Family interactions and sibling relationships

### Trajectory Framing
- **Supported:** "With emotional coaching, social skills support, and consistent co-regulation strategies at home and school, children can develop stronger peer relationships and emotional resilience."
- **Unsupported:** "Without support, social-emotional challenges can lead to peer rejection, behavioral escalation, and secondary impacts on self-esteem and academic engagement."

### Cross-Domain Connections
- **Social-Emotional → Speech & Language:** If language is also low, the emotional/behavioral challenges may be driven by communication frustration. Prioritize language intervention.
- **Social-Emotional → Sensory Processing:** Sensory overload can present as emotional dysregulation (meltdowns, withdrawal). Check whether the child's environment is a sensory trigger.
- **Social-Emotional → Gross Motor:** Children excluded from physical play due to motor difficulties may develop social withdrawal or low self-esteem.
- **Social-Emotional → Cognitive Learning:** Executive function challenges (common in ADHD profiles) affect both emotional regulation and academic task persistence.

### Referral Guidance
- **Yellow:** Social skills groups, emotional literacy activities, consistent co-regulation at home. Monitor over 3 months.
- **Red:** Developmental pediatrician or child psychologist consultation. Consider whether sensory or language factors are contributing before attributing challenges purely to social-emotional causes.

## Domain 5: Cognitive Learning (`cognitiveLearning`)

### What It Measures
Problem-solving, cause-and-effect reasoning, memory, task persistence, concept formation, attention to task, early academic readiness (counting, sorting, categorizing, pattern recognition).

### Zone Interpretation
- **Green:** Age-appropriate problem-solving and learning readiness. Strong protective factor. Can be leveraged to support weaker domains (e.g., using cognitive strengths to learn compensatory strategies).
- **Yellow:** Emerging cognitive skills with mild gaps in attention, task persistence, or concept generalization. May need repetition or multi-sensory teaching approaches.
- **Red:** Significant challenges in problem-solving, attention, or concept formation. Warrants educational psychology or developmental evaluation. Rule out attentional, sensory, or environmental factors before concluding cognitive delay.

### Impact on Daily Life — Framing Guide
- Classroom learning and academic task completion
- Following routines and multi-step sequences
- Problem-solving during play (puzzles, construction, games with rules)
- Attention span and task persistence during structured activities
- Ability to generalize learned skills to new contexts

### Trajectory Framing
- **Supported:** "With individualized learning strategies and multi-sensory instruction, children can develop stronger problem-solving skills and academic readiness."
- **Unsupported:** "Without support, cognitive challenges may compound over time as academic demands increase, leading to frustration and disengagement from learning."

### Cross-Domain Connections
- **Cognitive Learning → Fine Motor:** A child with strong cognition but weak fine motor may understand concepts they cannot demonstrate on paper. Do not underestimate cognitive ability based on written output.
- **Cognitive Learning → Speech & Language:** Language is the medium for much of cognitive assessment. If language is also low, the cognitive score may underrepresent true ability.
- **Cognitive Learning → Sensory Processing:** Sensory overload or under-stimulation can mimic attention deficits. Check sensory domain before concluding attention disorder.

### Referral Guidance
- **Yellow:** Age-appropriate puzzles, sorting games, problem-solving activities. Multi-sensory learning strategies.
- **Red:** Educational psychology assessment. Rule out attention, sensory, and language confounders.

## Domain 6: Adaptive Self-Care (`adaptiveSelfCare`)

### What It Measures
Independence in daily living tasks: dressing, feeding, toileting, hygiene, sleep routines, safety awareness, ability to follow household routines.

### Zone Interpretation
- **Green:** Age-appropriate independence in daily routines. Can manage most self-care tasks with minimal prompting.
- **Yellow:** Emerging independence with some reliance on adult support for complex tasks. May need extra time or visual prompts for multi-step routines.
- **Red:** Significant dependence on adult support for daily tasks. Warrants occupational therapy evaluation to assess underlying motor, cognitive, or sensory contributors.

### Impact on Daily Life — Framing Guide
- Morning and bedtime routine independence
- Dressing (buttons, zippers, shoe-tying)
- Feeding (utensil use, food management)
- Toileting independence
- Classroom independence (managing belongings, transitions)

### Trajectory Framing
- **Supported:** "With structured routines, visual schedules, and task-analysis approaches (breaking tasks into small steps), children can develop greater independence progressively."
- **Unsupported:** "Without support, continued dependence on adults can limit the child's confidence and autonomy, and may mask underlying motor or sensory challenges that benefit from intervention."

### Cross-Domain Connections
- **Adaptive Self-Care → Fine Motor:** Most self-care tasks (buttons, zippers, utensils, teeth brushing) require fine motor control. If fine motor is also low, address motor foundations first.
- **Adaptive Self-Care → Cognitive Learning:** Following multi-step routines requires sequencing ability and working memory.
- **Adaptive Self-Care → Sensory Processing:** Sensitivity to textures (clothing tags, food textures, water temperature) may underlie self-care resistance. Check sensory domain.

### Referral Guidance
- **Yellow:** Visual schedules, break tasks into smaller steps, positive reinforcement for independence. Monitor over 3 months.
- **Red:** Occupational therapy evaluation focused on daily living skills. Assess for underlying fine motor, sensory, or cognitive contributors.

## Domain 7: Sensory Processing (`sensoryProcessing`)

### What It Measures
How the child receives, processes, and responds to sensory input across modalities: tactile (touch), auditory (sound), visual (light), vestibular (movement/balance), proprioceptive (body awareness), oral-sensory (food textures, mouthing).

### Zone Interpretation
- **Green:** Adequate sensory regulation. Can manage typical environments without significant distress or seeking behavior.
- **Yellow:** Emerging sensory sensitivities or seeking patterns. May show mild preferences (e.g., avoids loud spaces, seeks movement) but can be managed with environmental adjustments.
- **Red:** Significant sensory regulation challenges. May present as sensory-seeking (constantly moving, touching, mouthing) or sensory-avoidant (covering ears, resisting textures, avoiding messy play). Warrants occupational therapy evaluation for sensory integration.

### Impact on Daily Life — Framing Guide
- Ability to focus in noisy or busy environments (classroom, shopping)
- Response to unexpected touch or sounds
- Food selectivity and mealtime challenges
- Clothing sensitivity (tags, seams, textures)
- Sleep regulation and calming for sleep
- Participation in group activities and play

### Trajectory Framing
- **Supported:** "With sensory strategies (sensory diet, environmental modifications, OT-guided activities), children can develop improved self-regulation and tolerance, enabling better participation in daily activities."
- **Unsupported:** "Without support, sensory challenges are frequently misinterpreted as behavioral problems (defiance, hyperactivity, withdrawal), leading to inappropriate management strategies that increase distress."

### Cross-Domain Connections
- **Sensory Processing → Social-Emotional:** Sensory overload is a common trigger for meltdowns, aggression, and social withdrawal. Always check sensory domain when social-emotional is flagged.
- **Sensory Processing → Gross Motor:** Vestibular and proprioceptive processing underpin motor coordination. Sensory-seeking via movement may indicate vestibular under-responsivity.
- **Sensory Processing → Speech & Language:** Auditory processing sensitivities can affect language reception. A child in a busy classroom may appear to have a language deficit when the issue is auditory filtering.
- **Sensory Processing → Adaptive Self-Care:** Tactile and oral-sensory sensitivities directly impact dressing (clothing textures) and feeding (food textures, utensil tolerance).
- **Sensory Processing → Cognitive Learning:** Sensory dysregulation consumes attentional resources. A dysregulated child cannot learn effectively. Address regulation before expecting cognitive gains.

### Referral Guidance
- **Yellow:** Sensory-friendly environment adjustments. Document sensory preferences and triggers. Monitor over 3 months.
- **Red:** Occupational therapy evaluation specializing in sensory integration. Implement sensory diet based on professional guidance.

## Domain 8: Vision & Hearing (`visionHearing`)

### What It Measures
Functional visual and auditory processing: response to visual stimuli, visual tracking, response to sounds and voices, auditory discrimination, localizing sound, functional use of vision and hearing in daily tasks.

### Zone Interpretation
- **Green:** Adequate visual and auditory processing for daily activities and learning. No functional concerns noted.
- **Yellow:** Mild concerns in visual or auditory processing. May show inconsistent responses to auditory or visual cues. Warrants monitoring and possibly screening by specialists.
- **Red:** Significant concerns in functional vision, hearing, or both. May not respond consistently to name, may hold objects very close to eyes, or may have difficulty in noisy environments. Immediate specialist evaluation recommended.

### Impact on Daily Life — Framing Guide
- Following visual and verbal instructions in the classroom
- Responding to name being called and conversational speech
- Engaging with books, screens, and visual learning materials
- Navigating environments safely
- Academic readiness (pre-literacy relies on visual and auditory discrimination)

### Trajectory Framing
- **Supported:** "With appropriate specialist evaluation and intervention (corrective lenses, hearing support, environmental seating adjustments), children can access learning and social opportunities more effectively."
- **Unsupported:** "Without evaluation, vision and hearing challenges can be misattributed to attention deficits, language delays, or non-compliance, leading to mismanaged support and missed learning opportunities."

### Cross-Domain Connections
- **Vision & Hearing → Speech & Language:** Hearing is foundational to language acquisition. History of ear infections (otitis media) during ages 1–3 may have impacted language development even if current hearing is normal.
- **Vision & Hearing → Cognitive Learning:** Visual and auditory processing are the primary channels for classroom learning. Low scores here may artificially depress cognitive and language scores.
- **Vision & Hearing → Social-Emotional:** A child who cannot reliably hear or see social cues may appear withdrawn, disengaged, or "in their own world."
- **Vision & Hearing → Sensory Processing:** Visual and auditory sensitivities may overlap with broader sensory processing challenges. Distinguish between acuity problems (need glasses/hearing aids) and processing problems (sensory integration).

### Referral Guidance
- **Yellow:** Schedule comprehensive vision screening (pediatric ophthalmologist) and hearing screening (audiologist). Ensure optimal classroom seating.
- **Red:** Immediate referral to pediatric ophthalmologist and audiologist. Implement classroom accommodations (preferential seating, visual aids paired with verbal instructions) while awaiting evaluation.

## General Playbook Rules

1. **Every domain gets a deep dive.** Even "Green" domains deserve clinical analysis acknowledging the strength and its protective role.
2. **Always contextualize with history.** If the child has ADHD, prematurity, bilingualism, or medical conditions, weave these into each relevant domain interpretation using the Clinical Logic Bank.
3. **Cross-reference domains.** When two or more domains are flagged (Yellow/Red), explicitly state the potential interconnection (e.g., "The combination of low sensory processing and low social-emotional scores suggests that sensory overload may be driving the emotional dysregulation, rather than a primary social-emotional deficit.").
4. **Use the zone label as the status.** Green = "On Track", Yellow = "Monitor", Red = "Evaluate".
5. **Never diagnose.** Use hypothesis language: "suggests," "may indicate," "consistent with patterns of," "warrants further evaluation for."
6. **Impact on Daily Life must be concrete.** Reference specific daily activities (getting dressed, sitting in class, playing with friends), not abstract concepts.
7. **Trajectory must contrast supported vs. unsupported paths.** Frame gently but honestly — parents need to understand why action matters.
8. **Seed activities** are provided in the input data per domain. Reference them in the trajectory or roadmap when relevant, but the clinical analysis should go beyond activity lists to explain the "why."
